Level 1: Basic Threading
Write a Python program that runs two functions concurrently using threading.
Each function should print numbers from 1 to 5 with a small delay between prints.

Goal:
Use threading.Thread to run two functions in parallel.
Ensure both functions print numbers without blocking each other.
